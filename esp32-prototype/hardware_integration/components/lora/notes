tx power can be set to 23 dBm because the rfm95 uses pa_boost
- Maybe?? I'm not so positive on this, arduino code implies it but the datasheet seems to imply 20dBm is max

study section 4.1, from page 23 onwords.
- Especially princiciple of operation!!!
- FIFO buffer is cleared when entering sleep mode, data is stored on any other mode switch.
- we should use implicit mode to ignore sending message `PayloadLength` and `FifoRxBytesNb`
- probably want to use `RxSingle` mode instead of continuous
- config registers should only be written in sleep and stand-by mode.

can use DIO1 as a hardware interrupt for RxTimeout
- we could short DIO0 and DIO1 then configure DIO1 to interrupt on RxTimeout when we enter receive mode (write 0 into DIO1 reg), otherwise it never generates an input (write 3 into DIO1 reg)

Really need to tweak Spreading factor, bandwidth, enable implicit header mode (and all that is implied with it)
- I believe we want high SF, low bandwidth, high power for the max range/robustness, but this will mean our packets have to be really small.
