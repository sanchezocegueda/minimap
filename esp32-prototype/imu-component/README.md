# LUCA TLDR
This is where development of the IMU component will take place. I think this will be a pretty big challenge we should focus on asap. The end goal is to have IMU heading readings that match our phone compass.
- Need to experiment with the Fusion library and verify the math in mpu9250.c
- I also hate the way this code is structured and would like to reformat it.
